- **Service ID:** 538e65e2-9d9b-4a0d-b5da-ee7d19fccc17

## 🎯 Current Status
✅ **Railway project exists and is configured**  
❌ **Deployment not currently accessible** (URLs tested failed)  
❌ **GitHub Actions missing RAILWAY_TOKEN**  

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Get Railway Token
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click your profile → **Account Settings** → **Tokens**
3. Click **Create New Token**
4. Name: `GitHub Actions Deploy`
5. **Copy the token** (starts with `railway_`)

### Step 2: Add Token to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
4. Value: Paste your Railway token
5. Click **Add secret**

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your existing project
railway link 634dc857-5a4c-405f-b1d8-d7c67af38732

# Deploy
railway up --service tech-board-2025
```

#### Option C: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your `believable-trust` project
3. Click on `tech-board-2025` service
4. Go to **Settings** → **Source**
5. Connect your GitHub repository
6. Set branch to `main`
7. Enable auto-deploy

### Step 4: Configure Railway Service

#### Build Settings (in Railway Dashboard):
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (if needed)
- **Start Command:** `node server/complete-production-server.js`
- **Root Directory:** `/` (project root)

#### Environment Variables (in Railway Dashboard):
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=tech-board-2025-secret-key
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

After deployment, check:
1. **Railway Dashboard** → Your project → Deployments
2. **Logs** for any errors
3. **Domains** tab for your public URL
4. **Health check** at `your-url/api/health`

## 🌐 Find Your Live URL

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your project in Railway dashboard
2. Click on `tech-board-2025` service
3. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
4. Your public URL will be listed there

### Method 2: Railway CLI
```bash
railway link 634dc857-5a4c-405f-b1d8-d7c67af38732
railway domain
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once deployed successfully, you should have:
- **Public URL** (something like `https://tech-board-2025-production-xxx.up.railway.app`)
- **Health endpoint** returning status OK
- **Database** with 1,750 questions
- **Admin login** working (admin/admin123)
- **Student registration** functional

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs --service tech-board-2025
   ```

2. **Verify files are deployed:**
   - `server/complete-production-server.js`
   - `server/database/mcq_system_fixed.db`
   - `server/public/index.html`

3. **Check environment variables in Railway dashboard**

4. **Verify build process:**
   - Client builds successfully
   - Files copied to `server/public/`
   - Database file included

### Common Issues:
- **Database not found:** Ensure `mcq_system_fixed.db` is committed to git
- **Build timeout:** Increase build timeout in Railway settings
- **Port issues:** Railway automatically sets PORT environment variable
- **Health check fails:** Verify server starts correctly

## 📋 Files Ready for Deployment

Your project has all required files:
- ✅ `server/complete-production-server.js` (production server)
- ✅ `server/database/mcq_system_fixed.db` (1,750 questions)
- ✅ `server/public/index.html` (built frontend)
- ✅ `.env.production` (environment config)
- ✅ `railway.json` (Railway configuration)
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` (build configuration)
- ✅ `Dockerfile` (container configuration)

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Get Railway token** from dashboard
2. **Add token** to GitHub secrets as `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
3. **Push to GitHub** to trigger deployment
4. **Check Railway dashboard** for deployment status
5. **Test live application** once deployed

**Your application is 100% ready - just needs the Railway token for deployment!**
