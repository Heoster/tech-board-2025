# 🔧 Registration Fix Summary

## ❌ Problem Identified
The student registration was failing with a **400 Bad Request** error because:
- **Client** was sending `rollNumber` (camelCase)
- **Server** was expecting `roll_number` (snake_case)

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Server-Side Fix** (`server/routes/auth.js`)
Updated the registration endpoint to handle both formats:

```javascript
// Before: Only handled roll_number
const { name, roll_number, password, grade, section } = req.body;

// After: Handles both rollNumber and roll_number
const { name, roll_number, rollNumber, password, grade, section } = req.body;
const studentRollNumber = roll_number || rollNumber;
```

### 2. **Client-Side Fix** (`client/src/services/authService.ts`)
Updated to send both formats for compatibility:

```javascript
async register(data: RegisterData) {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/auth/register', {
    name: data.name,
    roll_number: data.rollNumber, // Server expects this
    rollNumber: data.rollNumber,   // Also send for compatibility
    password: data.password,
    grade: data.grade,
    section: data.section
  });
  return response.data;
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Validation**
- Roll number validation: 1-100 range
- Section validation: Only A or B allowed
- Better error messages
- Proper data type conversion

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `server/routes/auth.js` - Fixed registration endpoint
- ✅ `client/src/services/authService.ts` - Fixed client request format
- ✅ Client rebuilt and copied to `server/public/`

### Next Steps:
1. **Push to Git Repository** - Railway will auto-deploy
2. **Test Registration** - Visit https://tech-board.up.railway.app/register
3. **Verify Fix** - Try registering a new student

## 🧪 Test Results

### Local Test Confirmed:
- ✅ Server now receives `rollNumber` field correctly
- ✅ Validation logic updated
- ✅ Both formats supported for backward compatibility

### Expected Behavior:
- Student registration should now work properly
- Form validation will show appropriate error messages
- Successful registration redirects to dashboard

## 📋 Registration Requirements Verified:
- **Name**: Minimum 2 characters
- **Roll Number**: 1-100 range, unique per grade/section
- **Password**: Minimum 6 characters
- **Grade**: Must be 6, 7, 8, 9, or 11
- **Section**: Must be A or B

## 🔄 Auto-Deployment
Railway will automatically redeploy when you push these changes to your Git repository. The fix is ready and tested locally.

## ✅ Status: **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
