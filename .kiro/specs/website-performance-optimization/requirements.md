# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines performance optimization improvements for the TECH BOARD 2025 MCQ Testing System. The system currently uses React with Vite on the frontend, Express.js with SQLite on the backend, and serves multiple grade levels with comprehensive question banks. Performance optimizations will focus on reducing load times, improving user experience during quiz sessions, optimizing database queries, and enhancing overall system responsiveness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a student taking an MCQ test, I want the application to load quickly so that I can start my exam without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the initial page load SHALL complete in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection
2. WHEN the application builds for production THEN the main bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 30% from current size
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN route transitions SHALL complete in under 500ms
4. WHEN the application loads THEN unused JavaScript SHALL be eliminated through tree shaking
5. WHEN assets are served THEN images and static files SHALL be compressed and optimized

### Requirement 2: Database Query Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database operations to be efficient so that the system can handle multiple concurrent users without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz questions are fetched THEN database queries SHALL execute in under 100ms for standard question sets
2. WHEN multiple students access the same grade's questions THEN the system SHALL implement query result caching
3. WHEN student responses are saved THEN batch operations SHALL be used for multiple submissions
4. WHEN the database is queried THEN proper indexes SHALL exist on frequently accessed columns
5. WHEN quiz data is loaded THEN only required fields SHALL be selected to minimize data transfer

### Requirement 3: API Response Optimization

**User Story:** As a student using the MCQ system, I want API responses to be fast so that my quiz experience is smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN response times SHALL be under 200ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN quiz data is requested THEN responses SHALL be compressed using gzip compression
3. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement response caching
4. WHEN API responses are sent THEN unnecessary data fields SHALL be excluded
5. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN the system SHALL support request batching where appropriate

### Requirement 4: Client-Side Caching Strategy

**User Story:** As a student taking multiple quizzes, I want previously loaded content to be cached so that subsequent interactions are faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user revisits a page THEN static assets SHALL be served from browser cache
2. WHEN quiz questions are loaded THEN appropriate cache headers SHALL be set for question data
3. WHEN user authentication tokens are valid THEN API responses SHALL be cached appropriately
4. WHEN the application updates THEN cache invalidation SHALL occur automatically
5. WHEN offline capability is needed THEN critical resources SHALL be available via service worker caching

### Requirement 5: Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

**User Story:** As a user accessing specific features of the MCQ system, I want only the necessary code to load initially so that the application starts faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN only the current route's code SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN different grade levels are accessed THEN grade-specific components SHALL be loaded on demand
3. WHEN admin features are accessed THEN admin-only code SHALL be loaded separately from student features
4. WHEN quiz components are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded asynchronously
5. WHEN the application builds THEN code splitting SHALL create optimized chunks for different user roles

### Requirement 6: Image and Asset Optimization

**User Story:** As a user on a slower internet connection, I want images and assets to load efficiently so that the application remains usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be served in modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
2. WHEN assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be compressed without significant quality loss
3. WHEN images are not immediately visible THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded
4. WHEN icons are used THEN they SHALL be optimized SVGs or icon fonts
5. WHEN the application serves static assets THEN appropriate cache headers SHALL be set

### Requirement 7: Memory Usage Optimization

**User Story:** As a student taking long quiz sessions, I want the application to maintain good performance throughout the session without memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN event listeners and subscriptions SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN quiz data is no longer needed THEN it SHALL be garbage collected appropriately
3. WHEN the application runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
4. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN memory-efficient algorithms SHALL be used
5. WHEN React components re-render THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be prevented through optimization

### Requirement 8: Server-Side Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system that serves multiple concurrent users, I want the server to handle requests efficiently so that response times remain consistent under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL implement connection pooling for database connections
2. WHEN static files are requested THEN they SHALL be served with appropriate caching headers
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN rate limiting SHALL be implemented to prevent abuse
4. WHEN the server processes requests THEN middleware SHALL be optimized for minimal overhead
5. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL implement proper logging without performance impact

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor application performance so that I can identify and address performance issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN key performance metrics SHALL be collected and logged
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN they SHALL be automatically detected and reported
3. WHEN users experience slow performance THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN their impact SHALL be measurable
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN performance metrics SHALL be available in real-time
