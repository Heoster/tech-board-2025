# üîß Question Duplication and Variation Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Addressed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Removed "Variation X" Text from All Questions**
- **Problem**: Questions had suffixes like "- Variation 22" making them look unprofessional
- **Solution**: Completely removed all variation text from 1,359 questions
- **Result**: Clean, professional question format

### 2. **Eliminated Duplicate Questions**
- **Problem**: Multiple identical questions with different variation numbers
- **Solution**: Kept only unique questions, removed 1,359 duplicates
- **Result**: No duplicate questions in the database

### 3. **Prevented Quiz Duplication**
- **Problem**: Same questions could appear multiple times in a single quiz
- **Solution**: Added duplicate detection in quiz generation
- **Result**: Each quiz now contains 50 unique questions

### 4. **Regenerated Complete Question Bank**
- **Problem**: After cleanup, only 25 questions remained (insufficient for quizzes)
- **Solution**: Generated 1,500 unique questions (300 per grade)
- **Result**: Sufficient questions for robust quiz generation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Constraints
```sql
-- Ensures no duplicate questions per grade/difficulty
UNIQUE(grade, question_text, difficulty)
```

### Quiz Generation Improvements
```javascript
// Remove duplicates in quiz generation
const uniqueQuestions = [];
const seenTexts = new Set();

for (const question of allQuestions) {
    const normalizedText = question.question_text.toLowerCase().trim();
    if (!seenTexts.has(normalizedText)) {
        seenTexts.add(normalizedText);
        uniqueQuestions.push(question);
    }
}
```

### Question Randomization
```javascript
// Random ordering instead of sequential
db.all(`
    SELECT id, question_text, difficulty
    FROM questions 
    WHERE grade = ?
    ORDER BY RANDOM()  -- Changed from ORDER BY id
`, [grade], ...)
```
