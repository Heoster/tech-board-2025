node deploy-production.js
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Railway)
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-min-32-chars
ADMIN_SECRET=your-super-secure-admin-secret-min-32-chars
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.railway.app
ENABLE_COMPRESSION=true
ENABLE_HELMET=true
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads correctly
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Database populated
- [ ] Admin panel functional
- [ ] Student registration working
- [ ] Quiz functionality working
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 3s load time)

### 4. Performance Verification
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] Bundle size < 10MB
- [ ] API response times < 200ms
- [ ] Database queries < 100ms
- [ ] Service Worker caching working

### 5. Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting working

## Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Response Times**: API endpoints < 200ms
- **Error Rates**: < 1% error rate
- **Uptime**: > 99.9% availability
- **Database Performance**: Queries < 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 80% of available
- **CPU Usage**: < 70% average

### Alerts to Configure
- Application downtime
- High error rates (> 5%)
- Slow response times (> 1s)
- Database connection issues
- High memory usage (> 90%)

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous Railway deployment
2. **Database**: Restore from backup if needed
3. **DNS**: Update if custom domain affected
4. **Monitoring**: Check all systems operational
