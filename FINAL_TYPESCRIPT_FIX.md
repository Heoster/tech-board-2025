# âœ… FINAL TypeScript Fix Applied

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
The AdminDashboard.tsx component had persistent JSX structure issues that were causing TypeScript compilation errors, specifically:
- JSX element 'main' has no corresponding closing tag
- Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'div'
- Missing parenthesis in conditional rendering

### Solution Applied
Replaced the problematic `<div>` wrapper in the dashboard conditional rendering with React Fragments (`<>` and `</>`):

**Before:**
```tsx
{activeTab === 'dashboard' && (
  <div>
    {/* Dashboard content */}
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{activeTab === 'dashboard' && (
  <>
    {/* Dashboard content */}
  </>
)}
```

### Why This Works
- React Fragments don't create additional DOM nodes
- Cleaner JSX structure without unnecessary wrapper divs
- Eliminates potential nesting conflicts
- More semantic and performant
