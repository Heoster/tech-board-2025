## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 7-Layer Duplicate Prevention System

1. **Database Constraints**
   - ✅ `idx_unique_quiz_question_response`: Prevents duplicates within a quiz
   - ✅ Unique constraints at database level

2. **Database Triggers**
   - ✅ `validate_quiz_completion`: Ensures exactly 25 unique questions per quiz
   - ✅ `prevent_duplicate_questions`: Blocks duplicate questions during insertion

3. **Application-Level Ultra-Strict Checking**
   - ✅ 5 different duplicate checks per question selection
   - ✅ Set-based, Map-based, Array-based validation
   - ✅ Historical usage tracking

4. **Cross-Quiz Uniqueness Tracking**
   - ✅ Maintains complete history of used questions per student
   - ✅ Excludes previously used questions from future selections

5. **Multi-Phase Validation**
   - ✅ Pre-selection validation (available question check)
   - ✅ During-selection validation (real-time duplicate prevention)
   - ✅ Post-selection validation (final integrity verification)

6. **Integrity Monitoring**
   - ✅ Real-time views monitor system health
   - ✅ Automated violation detection
   - ✅ Cross-quiz repetition tracking

7. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - ✅ Automated test suite validates no duplicates
   - ✅ Multi-quiz simulation testing
   - ✅ Production scenario validation
