## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

Once Railway deployment completes, you can verify everything works:

### **1. Basic Health Check**
```bash
curl https://tech-board.up.railway.app/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### **2. Admin Login Test**
```bash
curl -X POST https://tech-board.up.railway.app/api/auth/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'
# Should return: {"success":true,"token":"..."}
```

### **3. System Stats Test**
```bash
# Use token from admin login
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  https://tech-board.up.railway.app/api/admin/system-stats
# Should return system statistics
```

### **4. Automated Check**
```bash
node check-railway-deployment.js
# Runs comprehensive deployment verification
```
