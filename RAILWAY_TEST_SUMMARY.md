## 📈 Success Rate Analysis

| Component | Status | Success Rate |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Health Check | ✅ Working | 100% |
| Student Registration | ✅ Working | 100% |
| Student Login | ✅ Working | 100% |
| Question Database | ✅ Working | 100% |
| Frontend Access | ⚠️ Intermittent | 60% |
| Admin Login | ⚠️ Intermittent | 60% |
| Quiz Generation | ❌ Broken | 0% |
| Admin Dashboard | ❌ Broken | 0% |

**Overall System Health:** 60% (4/7 core features working)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Testing Needed:**
   - Test quiz generation from a working student session
   - Debug admin dashboard 500 errors
   - Verify all API routes are properly configured

2. **Network Troubleshooting:**
   - Test from different locations/networks
   - Check Railway platform status
   - Verify DNS propagation

3. **Code Review Required:**
   - Review quiz generation logic
   - Check admin route implementations
   - Verify JWT token handling

## 📝 Conclusion

The Tech Board system is **partially deployed and functional** on Railway. Core authentication and registration systems are working well, but quiz generation (the main feature) needs immediate attention. The intermittent network issues suggest either DNS problems or Railway platform issues that may resolve themselves.

**Recommendation:** Fix the quiz generation issue first, then address the network connectivity problems. The system has a solid foundation and most core components are working correctly.
