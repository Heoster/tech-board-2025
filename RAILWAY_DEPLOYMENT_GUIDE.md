# 🚂 TechBoard 2025 - Railway Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Production URL: https://tech-board.up.railway.app

Your TechBoard 2025 application is now **fully optimized** for Railway deployment and will work smoothly at the production URL.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

### Step 2: Link Project
```bash
railway link
# Or create new project: railway init
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

**That's it! Your app will be live at https://tech-board.up.railway.app**

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Validation

Run this to ensure everything is ready:
```bash
node validate-railway-env.js
```
