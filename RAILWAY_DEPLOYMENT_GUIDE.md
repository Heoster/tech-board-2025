```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login to Railway
railway login

# 3. Link to your project (if not linked)
railway link

# 4. Deploy
railway up
```

### Method 2: Using Git (Alternative)

```bash
# 1. Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy updated quiz system with enhanced features"

# 2. Push to Railway (if connected via GitHub)
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Manual File Upload

If CLI methods don't work, you can manually update specific files through Railway dashboard.
