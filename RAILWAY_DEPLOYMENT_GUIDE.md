railway up

# Or connect GitHub repository for automatic deployments
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health

### Logs & Debugging
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Check specific service logs
railway logs --service your-service-name
```

### Database Maintenance
```bash
# Check question counts
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health | jq '.questions'

# Verify no duplicates
node check-duplicate-questions.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
